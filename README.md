Quick User Config Editor

A rudimentary batch file made for the purpose of quickly editing AccountName and AccountId in user.config.ini files used by GSE Forks.

Simply select the directory for your game and the script will prompt you for your input.

I made this script with chatgpt because I needed a quick and dirty method of editing user.config.ini to go along achievement data grabbed by GSE-Generator for users to be able to customize it to their liking.
